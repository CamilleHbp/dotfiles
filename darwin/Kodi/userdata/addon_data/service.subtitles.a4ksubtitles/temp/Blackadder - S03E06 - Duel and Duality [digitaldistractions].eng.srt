1
00:00:35,905 --> 00:00:37,823
Mr Blackadder...

2
00:00:38,074 --> 00:00:43,371
Leave me alone Baldrick. If I'd wanted to talk to
a vegetable I'd have bought one at the market.

3
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:45,957
- Don't you want this message?
- No, thank you.

4
00:00:46,207 --> 00:00:49,961
God, I'm wasted here.
It's no life for a man of noble blood

5
00:00:50,211 --> 00:00:56,926
being servant to a master with the intellect of a
jugged walrus and all the social graces of a potty.

6
00:00:57,134 --> 00:01:01,764
I'm wasted too.
I've been thinking of bettering myself.

7
00:01:02,014 --> 00:01:05,851
I applied for the job
of village idiot of Kensington.

8
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,521
- Get anywhere?
- I got down to the last two.

9
00:01:08,771 --> 00:01:11,357
- But I failed the final interview.
- What went wrong?

10
00:01:11,607 --> 00:01:15,778
I turned up.
The other bloke was such an idiot he forgot to.

11
00:01:15,987 --> 00:01:20,283
I'm afraid my ambitions stretch slightly further
than professional idiocy in West London.

12
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:25,913
I want to be remembered when I'm dead. I want
books written about me, songs sung about me.

13
00:01:26,163 --> 00:01:29,542
And then, hundreds of years from now,
I want episodes from my life

14
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:35,673
to be played out weekly at half past nine
by some great heroic actor of the age.

15
00:01:35,923 --> 00:01:40,261
Yeah, and I could be played
by some tiny tit in a beard.

16
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:43,347
- Quite. Now, what's this message?
- I thought you didn't want it.

17
00:01:43,556 --> 00:01:46,434
- I may do. It depends what it is.
- So you do want it?

18
00:01:46,684 --> 00:01:51,063
- Well, I don't know, do I? It depends what it is.
- I can't tell you unless you want to know.

19
00:01:51,314 --> 00:01:54,900
Now I'm so confused I don't know
where I live or what my name is.

20
00:01:55,151 --> 00:02:01,032
Your name is of no importance and you live
in the pipe in the upstairs water-closet.

21
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,953
Was the man who gave you this, by any chance,
a red-headed lunatic with a kilt and a claymore?

22
00:02:06,162 --> 00:02:09,248
Yeah, and the funny thing is,
he looked exactly like you.

23
00:02:09,498 --> 00:02:14,712
My mad cousin McAdder. The most dangerous
man ever to wear a skirt in Europe.

24
00:02:14,962 --> 00:02:18,090
Yeah, he came in here playing the bagpipes,

25
00:02:18,341 --> 00:02:22,219
then he made a haggis, sang Auld Lang Syne
and punched me in the face.

26
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,182
- Why?
- I called him a knock-kneed Scottish pillock.

27
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:30,895
An unwise action, Baldrick,
since Mad McAdder is a homicidal maniac.

28
00:02:31,145 --> 00:02:33,773
My mother told me to stand up
to homicidal maniacs.

29
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:40,029
If this is the same mother who claimed
that you were a tall, handsome, stallion of a man,

30
00:02:40,279 --> 00:02:43,824
- I should treat her opinions with caution.
- I love my mum.

31
00:02:44,075 --> 00:02:47,787
And I love chops and sauce,
but I don't seek their advice.

32
00:02:48,037 --> 00:02:54,251
I hate it when McAdder turns up. He's such a
frog-eyed, beetle-browed basket-case.

33
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,046
- He's the spitting image of you.
- No, he's not!

34
00:02:57,296 --> 00:03:01,384
We're about as similar
as two completely dissimilar things in a pod.

35
00:03:01,634 --> 00:03:06,263
What's the old tartan throw-back
banging on about this time?

36
00:03:06,514 --> 00:03:10,768
"Have come South for rebellion."
Oh, God. Surprise, surprise.

37
00:03:11,018 --> 00:03:15,022
"Staying with Miggins...
the time has come... best sword in Scotland...

38
00:03:15,231 --> 00:03:20,903
insurrection... blood... large bowl of porridge...
rightful claim to throne..."

39
00:03:21,112 --> 00:03:23,239
He's mad. He's mad.

40
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:29,287
He's madder than Mad Jack McMad the winner
of last year's Mr Madman competition.

41
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,167
Ah! The walrus awakes.

42
00:03:35,418 --> 00:03:39,422
Blackadder, notice anything unusual?

43
00:03:39,672 --> 00:03:43,676
Yes, sir, it's 11:30 in the morning
and you're moving about.

44
00:03:43,884 --> 00:03:46,762
Is the bed on fire?

45
00:03:47,013 --> 00:03:50,891
Well, I wouldn't know,
I've been out "all night".

46
00:03:51,142 --> 00:03:55,187
Guess what I've been doing? Wraaarrhhh...

47
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,483
- Beagling, sir?
- Better even than that.

48
00:03:59,692 --> 00:04:03,904
Sink me, Blackadder, if I haven't just had
the most wonderful evening of my life.

49
00:04:04,155 --> 00:04:05,823
Tell me all, sir.

50
00:04:06,073 --> 00:04:11,495
As you know, when I set out I looked divine.
At the party, as I passed, all eyes turned.

51
00:04:11,746 --> 00:04:14,832
- And I dare say, quite a few stomachs.
- Well, that's right.

52
00:04:15,082 --> 00:04:20,880
And then these two ravishing beauties
came up to me and whispered in my ear

53
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,591
that they loved me.

54
00:04:23,841 --> 00:04:29,639
- And what happened after you woke up?
- This was no dream, Blackadder.

55
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:34,602
Five minutes later I was in a coach flying through
the London night bound for the ladies' home.

56
00:04:34,852 --> 00:04:41,317
And which ladies' home is this? A home for the
elderly or a home for the mentally disadvantaged?

57
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:45,237
No, no, no.
This was Apsley House. Do you know it?

58
00:04:45,488 --> 00:04:50,493
Yes, sir. It is the seat of the Duke of Wellington.
Those ladies, I fancy, would be his nieces.

59
00:04:50,743 --> 00:04:54,246
Oh, so you fancy them too?
Well, I don't blame you.

60
00:04:54,497 --> 00:04:58,793
I spent a night of ecstasy
with a pair of Wellingtons and I loved it.

61
00:04:59,043 --> 00:05:02,713
Sir, it may interest you to know
that the Iron Duke has always let it be known

62
00:05:02,964 --> 00:05:07,885
that he will kill in cold blood anyone who takes
sexual advantage of any of his relatives.

63
00:05:08,135 --> 00:05:11,681
Yes, but big-nose Wellington is in Spain
fighting the French - he'll never know.

64
00:05:11,931 --> 00:05:14,433
On the contrary, sir.
Wellington triumphed six months ago.

65
00:05:14,684 --> 00:05:18,062
- I'm dead.
- It would seem so, sir.

66
00:05:18,312 --> 00:05:22,358
- I haven't got a prayer, have I, Blackadder?
- Against throat-slasher Wellington,

67
00:05:22,608 --> 00:05:26,195
the finest blade His Majesty commands?
Not really, no.

68
00:05:26,404 --> 00:05:29,198
Then I shall flee.
How's your French, Blackadder?

69
00:05:29,407 --> 00:05:32,743
<i>Parfait, monsieur.
But I fear France will not be far enough.</i>

70
00:05:32,994 --> 00:05:38,207
- Well, how's your Mongolian?
- Mmm, "chang hatang motzo motzo".

71
00:05:38,457 --> 00:05:43,254
But I fear Wellington is a close personal friend
of the chief Mongol. They were at Eton together.

72
00:05:43,504 --> 00:05:46,424
I'm doomed. Doomed as the dodo.

73
00:05:46,674 --> 00:05:49,885
Oh, my God, he's here, Wellington's here already!

74
00:05:50,094 --> 00:05:56,017
Oh, Your Grace, forgive me. I didn't know what I
was doing. I was a mad, sexually overactive fool.

75
00:05:56,267 --> 00:05:59,437
Sir, it's Baldrick. You're perfectly safe.

76
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:00,855
Hurrah!

77
00:06:01,105 --> 00:06:03,691
- Until six o'clock tonight.
- Hurrooh.

78
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:06,485
From the Supreme Commander,
Allied Forces Europe.

79
00:06:06,694 --> 00:06:12,950
"Sir, prince or pauper, when a man
soils a Wellington he puts his foot in it."

80
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:20,541
"This is not a joke. I do not find my name
remotely funny, and people who do, end up dead."

81
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:25,004
"I challenge you to a duel tonight
at eighteen hundred hours in which you will die."

82
00:06:25,254 --> 00:06:29,842
"Yours, with sincere apologies for your impending
slaughter, Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington."

83
00:06:30,092 --> 00:06:32,261
Sounds a nice, polite sort of bloke.

84
00:06:35,014 --> 00:06:38,684
Don't worry, sir, please.
Just consider that life is a valley of woe

85
00:06:38,935 --> 00:06:41,687
filled with pain, misery, hunger and despair.

86
00:06:41,938 --> 00:06:47,193
Not for me. As far as I'm concerned life is
a big palace full of food, drink and comfy sofas.

87
00:06:47,443 --> 00:06:50,905
- May I speak, sir?
- Certainly not, Baldrick!

88
00:06:51,113 --> 00:06:54,033
The Prince is about to die.
The last thing he wants to do

89
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:57,912
is exchange pleasantries
with a certified plum-duff.

90
00:06:58,162 --> 00:07:00,414
Easy, Blackadder, let's hear him out.

91
00:07:00,665 --> 00:07:04,669
Very well, Baldrick.
We shall hear you out, then throw you out.

92
00:07:04,877 --> 00:07:11,008
Well, Your Majesty, I have a cunning plan
which could get you out of this problem.

93
00:07:11,258 --> 00:07:14,720
Don't listen to him, sir.
It's a cruel proletarian trick to raise your hopes.

94
00:07:14,971 --> 00:07:18,307
I shall have him shot the moment
he's finished clearing away your breakfast.

95
00:07:18,557 --> 00:07:23,688
No, wait. Perhaps this disgusting degraded
creature is some sort of blessing in disguise.

96
00:07:23,938 --> 00:07:26,148
Well, if he is, it's a very good disguise.

97
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:31,362
After all, did not our Lord send a lowly
earthworm to comfort Moses in his torment?

98
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,613
No.

99
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:36,784
Well, it's the sort of thing he might have
done. Well, come on, Mr Spotty, speak.

100
00:07:37,034 --> 00:07:41,998
Well, Your Majesty, I just thought -
this Wellington bloke's been in Europe for years.

101
00:07:42,248 --> 00:07:45,293
He don't know what you looks like.

102
00:07:45,543 --> 00:07:50,131
So why don't you get someone else
to fight the duel instead of you?

103
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:53,884
But I'm the Prince Regent!
My portrait hangs on every wall!

104
00:07:54,135 --> 00:07:56,137
Answer that, Baldrick.

105
00:07:56,387 --> 00:07:59,765
My cousin Bert Baldrick,
Mr Gainsborough's butler's dogsbody,

106
00:08:00,016 --> 00:08:06,272
he says that all portraits look the same these
days, 'cause they're painted to a romantic ideal,

107
00:08:06,522 --> 00:08:12,528
rather than as a true depiction of the idiosyncratic
facial qualities of the person in question.

108
00:08:12,778 --> 00:08:16,699
Your cousin Bert obviously has
a larger vocabulary than you do, Baldrick.

109
00:08:16,907 --> 00:08:22,580
He's right, damn him! Anybody could fight
the duel and Wellers would never know.

110
00:08:22,788 --> 00:08:28,711
Baldrick's plan does seem to hinge on finding
someone willing to commit suicide on your behalf.

111
00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:32,173
Yes, but he would be fabulously rewarded.

112
00:08:32,423 --> 00:08:35,760
- Money, titles, castles...
- Coffin.

113
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:40,139
That's right, I thought maybe Mr Blackadder
himself would fancy the job.

114
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:42,767
What a splendid idea!

115
00:08:43,017 --> 00:08:47,688
Excuse me, Your Highness.
Trouble with the staff.

116
00:08:50,066 --> 00:08:52,276
Baldrick, does it have to be this way?

117
00:08:52,485 --> 00:08:56,197
Our valued friendship ending
with me cutting you into long strips

118
00:08:56,405 --> 00:09:02,370
and telling the Prince that you walked over a very
sharp cattle-grid in an extremely heavy hat?

119
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:08,751
Mr Blackadder, you was only just saying
in the kitchen how you wanted to rise again.

120
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:12,171
But, tiny, tiny brain, the Iron Duke will kill me.

121
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:16,509
To even think about taking him on you'd have
to be some kind of homicidal maniac

122
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:20,763
who was fantastically good at fighting,
like McAdder...

123
00:09:20,972 --> 00:09:23,432
McAdder could fight the duel for me!

124
00:09:23,683 --> 00:09:28,854
My apologies, sir. I was just having a word
with my insurance people.

125
00:09:29,105 --> 00:09:32,233
Obviously I would be delighted
to die on your behalf.

126
00:09:32,483 --> 00:09:36,237
God's toenails, Blackadder, I'm most damnably
grateful. You won't regret this you know.

127
00:09:36,487 --> 00:09:40,825
Well, that's excellent. There's just one point,
though, sir, re: The suicide policy.

128
00:09:41,075 --> 00:09:46,205
There is an unusual clause which states
that the policyholder must wear a big red wig

129
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:49,125
and affect a Scottish accent in the combat zone.

130
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:52,378
Small print, eh?

131
00:09:53,546 --> 00:09:58,050
Ah, Mrs Miggins. Am I to gather
from your look of pie-eyed exhaustion

132
00:09:58,301 --> 00:10:00,761
and the globules of porridge hanging off the walls

133
00:10:01,012 --> 00:10:04,098
that my cousin McAdder
has presented his credentials?

134
00:10:04,307 --> 00:10:07,560
Oh yes, indeed, sir. You've just missed him.

135
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:12,732
- I hope he's been practising with his claymore.
- Oh, I should say so!

136
00:10:12,982 --> 00:10:17,153
I'm as weary as a dog with no legs
that's just climbed Ben Nevis.

137
00:10:17,403 --> 00:10:19,572
A claymore is a sword, Mrs Miggins.

138
00:10:19,822 --> 00:10:23,534
See this intricate wood carving
of the infant Samuel at prayer?

139
00:10:23,784 --> 00:10:27,455
He whittled that with the tip of his
mighty weapon with his eyes closed.

140
00:10:27,705 --> 00:10:29,123
Yes, exquisite.

141
00:10:29,373 --> 00:10:32,251
He bid me bite on a plank,
there was a whirlwind of steel,

142
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:37,298
and within a minute three men lay dead
and I had a lovely new set of gnashers.

143
00:10:37,548 --> 00:10:42,970
Just tell him to meet me here at five o'clock
to discuss an extremely cunning plan.

144
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:48,684
If all goes well, by tomorrow the clan of McAdder
will be marching the high road back to glory.

145
00:10:48,935 --> 00:10:51,938
I'll do you a nice packed lunch.

146
00:10:52,188 --> 00:10:53,773
Good news, Your Highness.

147
00:10:54,023 --> 00:10:59,737
This evening I will carve the Duke into a piece
of furniture with some excellent dental work.

148
00:10:59,987 --> 00:11:02,907
Your Highness? Your Highness!

149
00:11:03,157 --> 00:11:06,160
Oh, thank God it's you, Blackadder.

150
00:11:06,369 --> 00:11:09,956
I've just had word from Wellington,
he's on his way here now.

151
00:11:10,206 --> 00:11:13,417
The Duke must believe from the very start
that I am you.

152
00:11:13,668 --> 00:11:16,796
- Any ideas?
- There's no alternative, we must swap clothes.

153
00:11:17,046 --> 00:11:20,925
Fantastic, yes, dressing up. I love it.

154
00:11:21,175 --> 00:11:23,761
It's just like that story,
"The Prince And The Porpoise".

155
00:11:24,011 --> 00:11:25,513
"...and the Pauper"

156
00:11:25,763 --> 00:11:30,184
Oh, yes!
"The Prince and the Porpoise and the Pauper".

157
00:11:32,353 --> 00:11:36,440
Excellent, excellent.
Why, my own father wouldn't recognise me.

158
00:11:36,691 --> 00:11:39,735
Your own father never can. He's mad.

159
00:11:39,944 --> 00:11:43,948
Unfortunately, sir, you do realise
that I shall have to treat you like a servant?

160
00:11:44,198 --> 00:11:46,867
Oh, I think I can cope with that, Blackadder.

161
00:11:47,118 --> 00:11:50,663
And you will have to get used to calling me
"Your Highness", Your Highness.

162
00:11:50,871 --> 00:11:55,668
<i>- Your Highness, Your Highness.
- No, just "Your Highness", Your Highness.</i>

163
00:11:55,876 --> 00:12:00,172
That's what I said, "Your Highness,
Your Highness", Your Highness, Your Highness.

164
00:12:00,423 --> 00:12:04,927
Yes, let's just leave that for now, shall we?
Complicated stuff obviously.

165
00:12:05,177 --> 00:12:07,513
Big Nose is here...

166
00:12:07,763 --> 00:12:13,102
- But what? Who? Where? How?
- Don't even try to work it out, Baldrick.

167
00:12:13,352 --> 00:12:17,315
Two people you know well have exchanged coats
and now you don't know which is which.

168
00:12:17,565 --> 00:12:22,862
I must say I'm pretty confused myself!
Which one of us is Wellington?

169
00:12:24,322 --> 00:12:27,366
Wellington is the man at the door.

170
00:12:27,617 --> 00:12:31,412
And the porpoise?

171
00:12:32,913 --> 00:12:37,710
Hasn't arrived yet, sir.
We'll just have to fill in as best we can without it.

172
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,590
- Sir, if you would let the Duke in.
- Certainly, Your Highness, Your Highness.

173
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,760
And you'd better get out too, Baldrick.

174
00:12:45,968 --> 00:12:48,512
Yes, Your Highness, Your Highness.

175
00:12:48,763 --> 00:12:53,434
Oh, God!
If only they had a brain cell between them.

176
00:12:53,684 --> 00:12:55,353
The Duke of Wellington!

177
00:12:55,603 --> 00:12:58,105
Have I the honour
of addressing the Prince Regent, sir?

178
00:12:58,356 --> 00:13:00,191
You do.

179
00:13:00,441 --> 00:13:04,862
Congratulations, Highness,
your bearing is far nobler than I'd been informed.

180
00:13:05,112 --> 00:13:09,700
Take my hat at once, sir, and be quicker
about it than you were with the door!

181
00:13:09,951 --> 00:13:12,453
- Yes, my Lord.
- I'm a Duke, not a Lord!

182
00:13:12,662 --> 00:13:18,125
Where were you trained, a dago dancing class?
Shall I have my people thrash him for you?

183
00:13:18,376 --> 00:13:21,128
No, he's very new.
At the moment I'm sparing the rod.

184
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:24,340
Fatal error. Give them an inch
and before you know it they've got a foot,

185
00:13:24,548 --> 00:13:27,510
much more than that
and you don't have a leg to stand on.

186
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,054
Get out!

187
00:13:30,304 --> 00:13:32,306
Now, sir, to business.

188
00:13:32,556 --> 00:13:35,726
I am informed that your royal father
grows ever more eccentric

189
00:13:35,977 --> 00:13:41,315
and at present believes himself to be
"a small village in Lincolnshire,

190
00:13:41,565 --> 00:13:45,528
commanding spectacular views
of the Nene valley".

191
00:13:45,778 --> 00:13:50,825
I therefore pass my full account of the war
on to you, the Prince of Wales.

192
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:53,786
"We won." Signed Wellington.

193
00:13:53,995 --> 00:13:57,164
Well, that seems to sum it up very well.
Was there anything else?

194
00:13:57,415 --> 00:14:01,252
Two other trifling affairs, sir.
The men had a whip-round and got you this.

195
00:14:01,502 --> 00:14:05,256
Well, what I mean is, I had the men
roundly whipped until they got you this.

196
00:14:05,506 --> 00:14:10,720
It's a cigarillo-case engraved with the regimental
crest of two crossed dead Frenchmen,

197
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:14,515
emblazoned on a mound
of dead Frenchmen motif.

198
00:14:14,724 --> 00:14:18,185
Thank you very much.
And the other trifling thing?

199
00:14:18,436 --> 00:14:22,315
- Your impending death, Highness.
- Yes, of course, mind like a sieve.

200
00:14:22,565 --> 00:14:25,067
I can not deny I'm looking forward to it.

201
00:14:25,318 --> 00:14:29,363
Britain has the finest trade,
the finest armies, the finest navies in the world.

202
00:14:29,572 --> 00:14:33,826
And what do we have for royalty?
A mad Kraut sausage sucker

203
00:14:34,076 --> 00:14:37,872
and a son who can't keep
his own sausage to himself.

204
00:14:38,122 --> 00:14:40,541
- The sooner you're dead the better.
- You're very kind.

205
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:43,669
Now, you're no doubt anxious
to catch up with the news of the war.

206
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:46,714
I have here the most recent briefs
from my general in the field.

207
00:14:46,964 --> 00:14:50,968
Yes, well if you could just pop them
in the laundry basket on the way out. Tea?

208
00:14:51,177 --> 00:14:54,639
Yes, immediately.

209
00:14:54,931 --> 00:14:58,059
Now, let's turn to the second front, my Lord.

210
00:14:58,267 --> 00:15:02,104
Now, as I understand it,
Napoleon is in North Africa.

211
00:15:02,355 --> 00:15:05,942
- And Nelson is stationed in...
- Alaska, Your Highness.

212
00:15:06,192 --> 00:15:11,656
In case Bony should try and trick us
by coming via the North Pole.

213
00:15:12,073 --> 00:15:16,077
Perhaps a preferable stratagem, Your Grace,
might be to harry him amid-ships

214
00:15:16,327 --> 00:15:20,831
as he leaves the Mediterranean.
Trafalgar might be quite a good spot.

215
00:15:21,082 --> 00:15:23,876
Trafalgar? Well, I'll mention it to Nelson.

216
00:15:24,126 --> 00:15:26,837
I'm beginning to regret
the necessity of killing you, Your Highness.

217
00:15:27,088 --> 00:15:31,050
I'd been told by everybody
that the Prince was a confounded moron.

218
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,346
- Oh, no.
- Here's that tiresome servant of yours again.

219
00:15:35,554 --> 00:15:37,765
Budge up, budge up.

220
00:15:38,015 --> 00:15:41,394
How dare you
sit in the presence of your betters! Get up!

221
00:15:41,644 --> 00:15:45,022
- Cripes, yes, I forgot.
- You speak when you're spoken to.

222
00:15:45,273 --> 00:15:50,278
Unless you want to be flayed
across a gun carriage. Well?

223
00:15:50,486 --> 00:15:55,783
Sir, I fear you have been too long a soldier. We no
longer treat servants that way in London society.

224
00:15:56,033 --> 00:15:59,996
- Why, I hardly touched the man!
- I think you hit him very hard.

225
00:16:00,204 --> 00:16:04,041
Nonsense! "That" would have been a hard hit.

226
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,585
I just hit him like that.

227
00:16:06,836 --> 00:16:10,339
No, sir, a soft hit would be like this.

228
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:14,844
Whereas you hit him like this.

229
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,894
Please, um, I wonder if I might be excused,
Your Highness, Your Highness.

230
00:16:24,145 --> 00:16:26,522
Certainly.

231
00:16:26,772 --> 00:16:29,483
I'm sorry about that, sir,
but one has to keep up the pretence.

232
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:34,739
- I quite understand. You carry on the good work.
- Very well, sir.

233
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:39,952
Hang on, this is bloody coffee! I ordered tea!

234
00:16:40,202 --> 00:16:42,705
You really are a confounded fool, aren't you?

235
00:16:42,955 --> 00:16:48,544
I'd heard that the Prince was an imbecile, whereas
his servant Blackadder was respected about town.

236
00:16:48,794 --> 00:16:55,843
Now that I discover the truth,
I'm disposed to beat you to death. Tea!

237
00:17:00,097 --> 00:17:03,768
Tell me, do you ever stop bullying
and shouting at the lower orders?

238
00:17:04,018 --> 00:17:09,231
Never! There's only one way to win a
campaign: Shout, shout and shout again!

239
00:17:09,482 --> 00:17:14,946
You don't think then that inspired leadership
and tactical ability have anything to do with it?

240
00:17:15,154 --> 00:17:18,366
No! It's all down to shouting.

241
00:17:20,993 --> 00:17:23,496
I hear that conditions in your army are appalling.

242
00:17:23,746 --> 00:17:27,458
Well, I'm sorry, but those are my conditions
and you'll just have to accept them.

243
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,753
That is until this evening
when I shall kill you.

244
00:17:30,962 --> 00:17:34,131
- Who knows, maybe I shall kill you.
- Nonsense.

245
00:17:34,382 --> 00:17:39,512
I've never been so much as scratched,
my skin is as smooth as a baby's bottom.

246
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,140
Which is more than you can say for my bottom.

247
00:17:43,391 --> 00:17:47,478
One point, sir. I should, perhaps,
warn you that while duelling

248
00:17:47,687 --> 00:17:51,023
I tend to put on my lucky wig
and regimental accent.

249
00:17:51,274 --> 00:17:53,067
That won't help you.

250
00:17:53,317 --> 00:17:59,240
It would take a homicidal maniac
in a claymore and a kilt to get the better of me.

251
00:17:59,448 --> 00:18:01,367
Well, that's handy.

252
00:18:01,575 --> 00:18:05,413
I'm not leaving this kitchen
until that man is out of the house.

253
00:18:07,415 --> 00:18:11,085
It's all right, Your Majesty,
don't worry, I'll deal with this.

254
00:18:11,294 --> 00:18:15,298
Hello, Baldrick. I've brought your buns.
Where's Mr Blackadder?

255
00:18:15,548 --> 00:18:23,180
Oh, not upstairs still, running about after that
port-swilling, tadpole-brained smelly-boots?

256
00:18:23,431 --> 00:18:28,394
- I don't know who you mean.
- Prince George, Baldrick.

257
00:18:28,644 --> 00:18:33,399
His boots smell so bad a man would need to have
his nose amputated before taking them off.

258
00:18:33,649 --> 00:18:37,236
- Well, that's what Mr Blackadder says.
- As a joke.

259
00:18:37,486 --> 00:18:40,448
Didn't you write a little poem
about him last week?

260
00:18:40,698 --> 00:18:43,242
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, you did.

261
00:18:43,492 --> 00:18:50,708
"In the winter it's cool, in the summer it's hot,
but all the year round, Prince George is a clot."

262
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:54,587
A lovely.
I said Prince George is a lovely.

263
00:18:54,795 --> 00:19:00,301
I'd better be off anyway. Tell Mr Blackadder
to expect Mr McAdder at five o'clock.

264
00:19:00,551 --> 00:19:07,808
As soon as that fat Prussian truffle-pig has got
his snout wedged into a bucket of tea-cakes.

265
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:11,270
It must be next door you're wanting,

266
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:15,650
strange woman
whom I've never seen before, Mrs Miggins.

267
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,278
Baldrick! Is it true?

268
00:19:19,528 --> 00:19:24,575
Did you really write a poem
about how lovely I am?

269
00:19:25,576 --> 00:19:29,246
Yes, and Mr Blackadder loves you too.

270
00:19:29,497 --> 00:19:32,750
I must say I find that very touching. I do.

271
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,836
I wish they wouldn't keep on doing that.

272
00:19:36,045 --> 00:19:41,592
Goodbye, sir.
And may the best man win - i.e. Me.

273
00:19:41,676 --> 00:19:43,803
- Your tea, sir.
- You're late!

274
00:19:44,011 --> 00:19:47,765
Where the hell have you been for it? India?

275
00:19:47,974 --> 00:19:52,395
- Or Ceylon?
- Or China?

276
00:19:53,312 --> 00:19:59,652
Don't bother to show me the way out. I don't want
to die of old age before I get to the front door.

277
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:04,156
Ah! Miggins. So where's McAdder?
I thought he was going to be here at five o'clock.

278
00:20:04,407 --> 00:20:06,617
Yes, I'm sorry. He's just popped out.

279
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:11,330
You look ever so similar to each other,
you know, it's quite eerie.

280
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:16,085
- Look, did you tell him to be here or not?
- I did, you just keep missing each other.

281
00:20:16,335 --> 00:20:20,673
- I can't imagine why.
- I'll tell you why!

282
00:20:20,923 --> 00:20:24,802
It's because there's no coffee shop in England
big enough for two Blackadders.

283
00:20:25,052 --> 00:20:28,639
Ah! Good day, cousin McAdder.
I trust you are well.

284
00:20:28,889 --> 00:20:30,641
Aye, well enough.

285
00:20:30,891 --> 00:20:33,227
- And Morag?
- She bides fine.

286
00:20:33,436 --> 00:20:36,439
And how stands that mighty army,
the clan McAdder?

287
00:20:36,689 --> 00:20:39,817
They're both well.

288
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:43,154
I always thought
that Jamie and Angus were such fine boys.

289
00:20:43,404 --> 00:20:46,699
- Angus is a girl.
- Of course.

290
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:50,536
So, tell me, cousin,
I hear you have a cunning plan.

291
00:20:50,786 --> 00:20:52,622
I do, I do.

292
00:20:52,872 --> 00:20:58,252
I want you to take the place of the Prince Regent
and kill the Duke of Wellington in a duel.

293
00:20:58,502 --> 00:21:02,882
- Aye, and what's in it for me?
- Enough cash to buy the Outer Hebrides.

294
00:21:03,132 --> 00:21:06,969
- What do you think?
- Fourteen shillings and sixpence?

295
00:21:07,219 --> 00:21:10,806
Well, it's tempting.
But I've got an even better plan.

296
00:21:11,057 --> 00:21:15,603
Why don't I pretend to be the Duke of Wellington
and kill the Prince of Wales in a duel?

297
00:21:15,811 --> 00:21:21,108
Then I could kill the King and be crowned
with the ancient stone bonnet of McAdder.

298
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:28,240
And I shall wear the granite gown and limestone
bodice of MacMiggins, Queen of all the herds.

299
00:21:28,449 --> 00:21:31,160
Look, for God's sake, McAdder, you're not Rob Roy.

300
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:35,498
You're a top kipper salesman
with a reputable firm of Aberdeen fishmongers.

301
00:21:35,748 --> 00:21:40,795
Don't throw it all away. If you kill the Prince
they'll just send the bailiffs round and arrest you.

302
00:21:41,045 --> 00:21:43,297
Oh blast, I forgot the bailiffs.

303
00:21:43,547 --> 00:21:47,009
- So we can return to our original plan then?
- No, I'm not interested.

304
00:21:47,218 --> 00:21:49,845
I'd rather go to bed
with the Loch Lomond monster.

305
00:21:50,096 --> 00:21:52,431
And I have to be back in the office on Friday.

306
00:21:52,682 --> 00:21:58,229
I promised Mr McNaulty I'd shift
a particularly difficult bloater for him.

307
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:01,065
Forget the whole thing.
I'm off home with Miggsy.

308
00:22:01,315 --> 00:22:08,072
Yes, yes. Show me the glen where the kipper
roams free. And forget Morag forever.

309
00:22:08,322 --> 00:22:10,825
No, never. I must do right by Morag.

310
00:22:11,033 --> 00:22:14,745
We must return to Scotland and you must
fight her in the old Highland way -

311
00:22:14,954 --> 00:22:18,291
bare-breasted
and each carrying an eight pound baby.

312
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:21,669
Yes! I love babies.

313
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,132
You're a woman of spirit! I look forward
to burying you in the old Highland manner.

314
00:22:26,382 --> 00:22:30,261
Farewell, Blackadder, you spineless goon.

315
00:22:30,511 --> 00:22:37,893
Oh, God!
Fortune vomits on my eiderdown once more.

316
00:22:38,144 --> 00:22:44,191
Ah, Blackadder. It has been a wild afternoon
full of strange omens.

317
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,695
I dreamt that a large eagle
circled the room three times,

318
00:22:47,945 --> 00:22:50,531
and then got into bed with me
and took all the blankets.

319
00:22:50,781 --> 00:22:54,619
And then I saw that it wasn't an eagle at all
but a large black snake.

320
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:58,998
Also, Duncan's horses did turn
and eat each other - as usual.

321
00:22:59,206 --> 00:23:03,878
- Good portents for your duel, do you think?
- Not very good, sir. I'm afraid the duel is off.

322
00:23:04,086 --> 00:23:07,506
- Off?
- As in "sod". I'm not doing it.

323
00:23:07,757 --> 00:23:12,970
By thunder, here's a pretty game. You will stay,
sir, and do duty by your Prince or I shall...

324
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:18,935
Or what, you port-brained twerp?
I've looked after you all my life.

325
00:23:19,185 --> 00:23:24,190
Even when we were babies I had to show you
which bit of your mother was serving the drinks.

326
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,069
Please, please, you've got to help me.
I don't want to die.

327
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:33,491
- I've got so much to give. I want more time.
- A poignant plea, sir.

328
00:23:33,699 --> 00:23:38,704
But the answer, I'm afraid, must remain:
"You're going to die, fat pig".

329
00:23:38,955 --> 00:23:43,459
Oh, wait, wait! I'll give you everything.

330
00:23:44,377 --> 00:23:48,339
Everything?
The money, the castles, the jewellery?

331
00:23:48,547 --> 00:23:52,343
The highly artistic
but also highly illegal set of French lithographs?

332
00:23:52,593 --> 00:23:53,803
Everything.

333
00:23:54,053 --> 00:23:58,266
The amusing clock where the little man comes out
and drops his trousers every half hour?

334
00:23:58,474 --> 00:24:01,185
- Yes, yes, all right.
- Very well, I accept.

335
00:24:01,394 --> 00:24:05,898
A man may fight for many things:
His country, his principles, his friends,

336
00:24:06,148 --> 00:24:09,026
the glistening tear on the cheek of a golden child.

337
00:24:09,235 --> 00:24:12,863
But personally
I'd mud-wrestle my own mother for a ton of cash,

338
00:24:13,072 --> 00:24:18,411
an amusing clock,
and a sack of French porn. You're on.

339
00:24:21,122 --> 00:24:22,456
Here's the plan.

340
00:24:22,707 --> 00:24:28,337
When he offers me the swords, I kick him
in the nuts and you set fire to the building.

341
00:24:28,587 --> 00:24:31,257
In the confusion we claim a draw.

342
00:24:31,507 --> 00:24:34,135
Your Highness, let's be about our business.

343
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:38,681
Don't forget, Baldrick. You... when I...

344
00:24:38,889 --> 00:24:43,227
Come, sir. Choose your stoker.

345
00:24:44,228 --> 00:24:49,358
- Are we going to tickle each other to death?
- No, sir. We fight with cannon.

346
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:52,153
But I thought we were fighting with swords.

347
00:24:52,403 --> 00:24:57,992
What do you think this is, the Middle Ages?
Only girls fight with swords these days.

348
00:24:58,242 --> 00:25:01,829
Stand by your gun, sir.
Hup two three! Hup two three!

349
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:03,331
Wait a minute!

350
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:08,461
Stand by cannon for loading procedure.
Stoke! Muzzle! Wrench!

351
00:25:08,711 --> 00:25:16,010
"Congratulations on choosing the Armstrong
Whitworth four-pounder cannonette."

352
00:25:16,218 --> 00:25:22,308
"Please read instructions carefully and it should
give years of trouble-free maiming."

353
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:24,894
Check elevation!

354
00:25:25,102 --> 00:25:29,774
Chart trajectory! Prime fuse! Aim!

355
00:25:29,982 --> 00:25:33,027
- Wait a minute.
- Fire!

356
00:25:33,778 --> 00:25:39,867
- Mr B! Sir, please help me get his coat off.
- Leave it, Baldrick. It doesn't matter.

357
00:25:40,117 --> 00:25:43,704
Yes it does. Blood's hell to shift.
I want to get it in to soak.

358
00:25:43,913 --> 00:25:46,832
You die like a man, sir - in combat.

359
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:51,837
You think so? Dammit, we must build
a better world. When will the killing end?

360
00:25:52,088 --> 00:25:54,632
You don't think I too dream of peace?

361
00:25:54,882 --> 00:26:00,137
You don't think that I too yearn to end
this damn dirty job we call soldiering?

362
00:26:00,388 --> 00:26:04,850
Frankly, no. My final wish on this Earth
is that Baldrick be sold

363
00:26:05,101 --> 00:26:08,437
to provide funds
for a Blackadder foundation to promote peace

364
00:26:08,646 --> 00:26:13,776
and to do research into the possibility
of an automatic machine for cleaning shoes.

365
00:26:14,026 --> 00:26:16,946
And so I charge...

366
00:26:17,196 --> 00:26:19,282
His Highness is dead.

367
00:26:19,532 --> 00:26:22,076
Actually, I'm not sure I am.

368
00:26:22,285 --> 00:26:29,000
That cigarillo-box you gave me was placed exactly
at the point where the cannon-ball struck.

369
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:32,336
I always said smoking was good for you.

370
00:26:32,586 --> 00:26:37,133
Honour is satisfied.
God clearly preserves you for greatness.

371
00:26:37,383 --> 00:26:40,011
His Highness is saved. Hurrah!

372
00:26:40,261 --> 00:26:45,391
Um, no actually, it's me. I'm His Highness.
Well done, Bladders, glad you made it.

373
00:26:45,641 --> 00:26:49,937
What in the name of Bonaparte's balls
is this fellow doing now?

374
00:26:50,187 --> 00:26:54,775
No, I really am the Prince. It was all just larks,
and darn fine larks at that I thought.

375
00:26:54,984 --> 00:26:59,238
I have never, in all my campaigns,
encountered such insolence!

376
00:26:59,488 --> 00:27:04,535
Your master survives an honourable duel
and you cheek him like a French whoopsy!

377
00:27:04,744 --> 00:27:09,123
I can contain myself no longer!

378
00:27:10,082 --> 00:27:15,963
I die. I hope men will say of me
that I did duty by my country.

379
00:27:16,213 --> 00:27:21,177
I think that's pretty unlikely, sir. If I was you
I'd try for something a bit more realistic.

380
00:27:21,385 --> 00:27:25,556
- Like what?
- You hope that men will think of you as a thicky.

381
00:27:25,806 --> 00:27:29,310
All right, I'll hope that.
Toodle-oo, everyone.

382
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,021
Kneel for His Majesty, the King of England!

383
00:27:32,229 --> 00:27:35,191
Somebody told me my son was here.

384
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:44,700
I wish him to marry this rose-bush.
I want to make the wedding arrangements.

385
00:27:45,326 --> 00:27:48,079
Here I am, Daddy.

386
00:27:48,329 --> 00:27:52,458
This is the Iron Duke Wellington,
commander of all your armed forces.

387
00:27:52,708 --> 00:27:55,586
Yes, I recognised the enormous conk.

388
00:27:55,836 --> 00:28:00,007
- He's a hero. A man of wit and discretion.
- Bravo!

389
00:28:00,258 --> 00:28:06,347
You know, my son, for the first time in my life
I have a real fatherly feeling about you.

390
00:28:06,597 --> 00:28:12,478
People may say I'm stark raving mad
and say the word Penguin after each sentence,

391
00:28:12,687 --> 00:28:16,565
but I believe that we two can make Britain great,

392
00:28:16,816 --> 00:28:21,946
you as the Prince Regent and I as King Penguin.

393
00:28:22,196 --> 00:28:23,698
Well, let's hope, eh?

394
00:28:23,948 --> 00:28:26,617
Wellington, will you come
and dine with us at the palace?

395
00:28:26,867 --> 00:28:30,079
- My family have a lot to thank you for.
- With great pleasure.

396
00:28:30,329 --> 00:28:34,583
Your father may be as mad as a balloon,
but I think you have the makings of a fine king.

397
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:38,129
<i>Eine wunderbare Hochzeit ja!</i>

398
00:28:38,337 --> 00:28:43,301
Baldrick, clear away that dead butler, will you?

399
00:28:45,261 --> 00:28:53,060
There's a new star in heaven tonight.
A new freckle on the nose of the giant pixie.

400
00:28:53,561 --> 00:28:59,191
No, actually Baldrick, I'm not dead.
You see, I had a cigarillo-box too, look.

401
00:28:59,442 --> 00:29:03,487
Oh, damn, I must have left it on the dresser...
