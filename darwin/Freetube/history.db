Using a wash might be a good idea, but is there a way to shade your miniatures more easily? Today, we will also mention speedpainting methods for warhammer.\n\nToday's sponsor is Shieldwolf Miniatures: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shieldwolf/imperium-desertum-imperium-immortalis?ref=profile_created\n\nHave you ever wondered if there is a way that could be easier than washing your miniature to shade it? Well, using a wash to stack shades in the recesses might be effective when it comes to painting fur, bases, terrain and other stuff with a plenty of texture, but what about that flat armor? Space marines and tanks certainly don't enjoy full washes. Recess shading might be one of your options, but using oil wash or enamel wash for panel lining is also a great idea! Using washes like these will make them go straight into recesses, effectively panel lining your miniature.\n\nCertainly, when I finally paint the entire half of my space marine indomitus box, I will use one of the faster panel lining methods mentioned instead of recess shading.\n\nThese videos are essential watch if you want to improve:\nPainting Volumes: https://youtu.be/mw4NcKqaPJ0\nPainting Non Metallic Metal: https://youtu.be/wOGlHTRySlU\n\nThese hobby tools are a MUST if you wanna improve: https://youtu.be/UqgElHtomVw \n\nSupport the channel by purchasing any hobby products using following links (As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases you do after using these links at no extra cost for you)\n\nAmazon US:\nAny product: https://amzn.to/37GMBGT\nI use Panasonic GH5 camera: https://amzn.to/3qNOTLP\nBasic Vallejo Colors: https://amzn.to/3pJd2BI\nLAMP: https://amzn.to/3s7wiuK \nVallejo Texture Paste: https://amzn.to/3CiHA4M\nWinsor and Newton series 7 brush: https://amzn.to/3yshutO\nStarting airbrush set: https://amzn.to/3s8NhwI\n\nAmazon UK:\nAny product: https://amzn.to/3wGfBK3\nI use Panasonic GH5 camera: https://amzn.to/30aZVCX\nBasic Vallejo paints: https://amzn.to/30fybNn\nLAMP: https://amzn.to/3og7T5J\nStarting airbrush set: https://amzn.to/2YzNDTD\n\nAmazon DE (and EU):\nAny product: https://amzn.to/392bXzs\nI use Panasonic GH5 camera: https://amzn.to/3w30DNJ\nBasic Vallejo paints: https://amzn.to/3cdUmH0\nLAMP: https://amzn.to/37hqAh1 \nStarting airbrush set: https://amzn.to/39h2CUT\n\nI use 3D printer from Anycubic: https://bit.ly/3akLGfP\n\nAll the music and soundeffects are from Epidemic Sound, support the channel by registering via this link: https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/npn6j7/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/zumikit0/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/zumikit0/\n\nI am painting miniatures for warhammer, age of sigmar, marvel crisis protocol, D&D and much more!

His site, AdvancedFictionWriting.com is packed with loads of information and inspiration on organizing, creating and marketing your work.\n\nWe discuss:\n\n    How Randy established his brand when he wanted to talk about the process of writing, as well as the aspects of his novels. He brings the scientific approach and step by step process to writing a novel.\n\n    How the Snowflake method works - from something simple and small, to growing it out bit by bit to something complicated and beautiful. The book is told as a parable, which 'shows' the method through a woman at a writing conference who wants to learn how to write and is frustrated when she can't use the pantsing or plotting approach.\n\nThe importance of only using writing methods that work for you as an individual.\n\n    Tips on writing the one line that sums up your book.\n\n    The scene list and what a scene actually is. [This really changed my writing life when I understood the concept of scene.] Scene vs chapter. How to write a perfect scene. A chapter is a fundamental unit of reader decision.\n\n\"Most fiction writers have a major bottleneck in their process. That bottleneck is that they don‚Äôt produce enough first-draft copy.\"\n\n    On writing 500 words a day as a matter of habit.\n\n    [25 mins] Randy talks about his panic disorder which affected his public speaking opportunities. We talk about our flaws and how we deal with them in a really honest way.\n\nYou can find Randy at http://www.AdvancedFictionWriting.com where he has a brilliant free ezine, as well as loads more information on writing fiction.","viewCount":49240,"lengthSeconds":1915,"watchProgress":6.583175,"timeWatched":1679502914860,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"2zaOO0gzTtwKv7wm"}

The 90s in France, an era that's overflowing with timeless albums : deep and complex lyrics, unrivalled biting flows and powerful productions. Emcees of great stature and personality, capable of embodying their roles to perfection as the players in a new scene that had the important role of relating social and political issues of minorities that hardly had the chance to have themselves heard. \n\n90s Classic French Rap' Mixes aim is to display French emcees and producers' talent beyond the boarders of France, and to pay homage to the cultural heritage they left behind. Feel free to give them props if you like their music, even if you don't speak French!\n\n‚Üí French Hip-hop:\n\nAlthough America is clearly at the top of the hip-hop food chain, France has always been a fairly close second, with a thriving scene that dates back to the mid-80s. A huge factor in the development of French hip-hop was the TV show HIPHOPaired, which featured music videos and live performances from global rap artists (even Kurtis Blow passed through one time). The show even pre-dated Yo! MTV Raps, suggesting that mainstream French culture was more ready to accept hip-hop than America was at that time.\n\nLike hip-hop across the pond, and most other cultures, it was birthed in France through political movement and was used as a tool to protest the treatment of poverty-stricken citizens in Parisian ghettos and the racial discrimination immigrants and their children faced. It really was (and still is) their one true voice. The scene there has rapidly developed into something incredibly diverse-sounding‚Äîpolitical hip-hop is still at the core, but gangsta and jazz-infused rap has also risen to prominence.\n\nRap evolved in France in a very similar way to what happened in the States but on a slight time delay, as it was the mid-90s where legends really started to be created. Some of this was thanks to the influence of Mathieu Kassovitz's iconic film, La Haine (which is basically a French Do The Right Thing), and its thumping hip-hop soundtrack that included pioneering groups such as Assassin and NTM. The French hip hop scene is still booming today, especially in Paris, which has a fierce underground scene and where most of the country's prominent rappers reside.\n- Sam Moore, complex UK\n\n#frenchrap #frenchhiphop #rapfran√ßais #hiphop #rap #boombap #90shiphop #90s","viewCount":2784990,"lengthSeconds":2824,"watchProgress":0.020273,"timeWatched":1681324865918,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"5s4ttMbOA4uFNBov"}

The reason for this is that it scales well and is a good fit for the access control needs of many large organizations. RBAC is not the only access control model out there, but it is a very popular one.\nIn this video we walk through the main concepts of RBAC, which are capabilities, permissions, roles, and users. We also discuss the relationships between these concepts, for example the fact that users can play multiple roles.\nLast but not least, we point out some alternatives such as Access Control Lists (ACL) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC).\n\nSlides online: https://dret.net/lectures/getting-apis-to-work-2021/rbac\n\n\n0:00 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Introduction\n0:41 RBAC Model: Capability\n0:57 RBAC Model: Permission\n1:45 RBAC Model: Role\n2:25 RBAC Model: User\n3:38 RBAC Relationships: User\n3:47 RBAC Relationships: Role\n4:18 RBAC Relationships: Permission\n5:00 RBAC Relationships: Capability\n5:49 Enterprise-level Access Control","viewCount":20320,"lengthSeconds":480,"watchProgress":0,"timeWatched":1684048894420,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"7pX7CFuz5ONebQBJ"}

React Query provides a hooks API which allows you to fetch, cache, and update data. At first glance it seems like just a simple library, however you'll find out that it is packed with features which pretty much handle most of the server state management concerns that you might have in any client application. This includes things like automatically de-duping requests, background refreshing, caching, optimistic updating, accessing data globally and several others.\n\nIf you make React Query manage your server state, you'll find that the remaining client state that requires management becomes VERY small and likely will remove the need for more complex solutions like Redux. This is state management solution that you absolutely should know about if you're a React developer!\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:25 - Why you need React Query\n02:08 - What we're going to build in this tutorial\n03:15 - Using axios to define our reusable API methods\n05:09 - Setting up the QueryClient and Devtools\n07:10 - Intro to fetching data with the useQuery hook\n10:06 - Utilizing loading states\n11:21 - Catching errors and basic error handling\n21:05 - Important defaults to know about\n21:26 - Auto Caching and garbage collection\n22:44 - Auto background data refetching/refreshing\n30:00 - Using mutations and the useMutation hook to update data\n33:56 - Invalidating data in the cache (trigger refresh)\n36:44 - Optimistic updates\n39:58 - Updating the cached data using the response data\n42:55 - Looking at what else React Query provides\n43:36 - Conclusion: Discuss the point of React Query and if you still need things like Redux\n45:23 - Outro","viewCount":44874,"lengthSeconds":2753,"watchProgress":1713.158807,"timeWatched":1672655608653,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"814uPydqWtYlb3rc"}

Back then it was hailed as the best game no-one played so it was a bit of a 'sleeper'. Age of Wonders 3 came out in 2014 so it has been around for a while but is a modern classic. At time of recording Age of Wonders Planetfall is just aroung the corner and I suspect that version 3 will have a resurgence with that sci-fi version release and that was the inspiration behind putting out this series.\n\nPLAYLIST:\nTo watch other videos in this series please check out the playlist.

Our study music is perfect for concentration, helping you work more effectively and get more done.\nFocus music is a powerful tool for enhancing a person's creativity and productivity. Listening to the right kind of focus music can help people stay more energized and focused when working on a creative project or task. This type of music is designed to provide listeners with an ambient background sound that keeps them engaged in their work without distracting them.\n\nFocus music for work can be a great tool to help boost productivity and creativity in the office. Listening to focus music while working has been proven to improve productivity levels, allowing employees to complete tasks more quickly and efficiently. Focus music is designed specifically for those who seek an enhanced workflow by helping them stay focused on their task at hand and block out distractions. \n\nThe right type of focus music can help reduce stress, enabling a more pleasant work environment, which further increases productivity levels. It has also been found that listening to calming background melodies allows people to become more creative as they are better able to think outside the box. Research shows that when workers listen to focus music while working, they were found to have greater attention spans, less mental fatigue and better overall job performance than without it. \n\n~ My other channels: \nSub Bass Meditation Music ‚ñ∫ https://goo.gl/Q3dSdU\nMeditation Cloud ‚ñ∫ https://goo.gl/oGVo9F\nSleepuma ‚ñ∫  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdFKZcJxIyApmTUWtQJaxuQ\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n- FACEBOOK\nhttps://goo.gl/FfNFoa\n- Twitter\nhttps://goo.gl/BmEf8o\n- Our website\nhttps://goo.gl/SWuQNw","viewCount":38150723,"lengthSeconds":32933,"watchProgress":0.527837,"timeWatched":1682243712588,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"CWnVviH77VDZcG9w"}

How can we be sure that pain is a solid guiding principle as we navigate the world? What is the underlying structure of pain, and what does it point at?\n\nWe also touched on a myriad of topics around those central themes, such as sin and the symbol of the snake, giving advice, resurrection, the relationship between faith and suffering, evil, the effect we have on others, and sunsets.\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://linktr.ee/DrJordanBPeterson\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com/\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\n\n#Pain #Suffering #Bible #Faith #Evil #FranciscanUniversity #JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus #podcast","viewCount":1300345,"lengthSeconds":3486,"watchProgress":2.798748,"timeWatched":1673632191937,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"DRFYmTudGjNLVGxJ"}

I know it's been a while since my last video...  A lot has happened.  Also, sorry about the poor video quality and stuff, I'm still getting everything sorted out and really it was a matter of either making an imperfect video or not making anything at all...  Also the picture I drew for this is just whatever because I didn't know what to do but felt the video probably needed some art thing in the background.  Alright, enough about that, if you're still reading this, well, I am surprised!  I bet most people will never see whatever I'm writing here.  I probably could just write whatever and maybe 2% of people will see it.  I guess if you got this far, you can write \"I found the secret stallion!\" in the comments and people will be confused about what the heck that is about.  Or you don't have to, lol.  It's just dumb.  I'm dumb.

After the horror that was focusing on the navy in the last episode we won't be doing any gimmicks this time. Especially since it has now been quite a while since I last played the game!\n\nFor this campaign we will be playing as Bactria and go for their associated achievements which are:\n\n- The Man who would be King\n- To the End of the World\n\nThere is a bit of an overlap between them but essentially it means we need to become independent and conquer our way into the Indian subcontinent. As for most of the campaigns we have been running recently the start is the dangerous part. We start as a subject to the Seleukids and we also have Maurya to the east breathing down our neck even after we become independent.\n\nThe initial plan is to wait for the Seleukids to start fighting the Antigonids and use that as an opportunity to break free. After that we shall hope that Maurya focuses mainly on the southern part of India before they start eyeing us up. Can we survive these initial dangers, the rest of the run should be relatively smooth (famous last words!).\n\nAs always, hope you enjoy!\n\nPlaylist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtfz6OsHDpNlF9_1Rq4ba79olNb2dail5\n\n\nImperator: Rome\nCopyright ¬© 2019 Paradox Interactive AB. www.paradoxplaza.com\n\nThumbnail image by Syaibatulhamdi from Pixabay (https://pixabay.com/users/syaibatulhamdi-13452116/)\n\n#Fungusen #ImperatorRome #strategy","viewCount":449,"lengthSeconds":1521,"watchProgress":407.594738,"timeWatched":1686244041443,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"I1puZ4v738NVPC7q"}

Listen to this when you need a strong burst of intense focus to concentrate and study things like advanced mathematics, scientific formulas, financial analysis or any other complex mental activity. \n\nHow is this session constructed?\n\nThe session starts off beating at 10Hz and ramps up to 18Hz by the 6-minute mark.  It stays at 18Hz until the final 5 minutes where it ramps back down again.\n\nHow to use it?\n\nListen to this track with your eyes open while doing the task/activity you want to focus on.\n\nHeadphones are NOT required\n\nAlthough headphones are not required you may find they produce a more intense effect, because they help to block out distracting external sounds. \n\nWhen to listen?\n\nBecause this track increases your beta brainwave activity, it's best to listen to this during the daytime and early evening.  If you listen to this too close to bedtime, it might disrupt your sleep, in a similar way to how you might respond if you drank coffee just before going to bed.\n\nHow loud should the volume be?\n\nThe main thing to consider is that it should be loud enough to hear the repetitive isochronic tones, so you don't want it so quiet you can hardly hear them.  But you also don't want it so loud that it's uncomfortable for you and hurts your ears, or gives you a headache.  I'd recommend starting with the volume around halfway and adjust it to a level that you feel comfortable with from there.\n\n#upbeatstudymusic\n#studymusic\n#focusmusic\n\n---\nArtist credit: Mintz, from the album Butterflies.\nThe Blue Jay, Mid Side, Over the Past Year, Metric","viewCount":1030111,"lengthSeconds":10800,"watchProgress":4153.45455,"timeWatched":1682674157987,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"JvYUnx1DXYhKTrHi"}

With this routine, I was able to increase my body flexibility and achieve the full splits as a complete beginner, in just a few short weeks! :)\n\nI have never really been the most flexible guy, but I've always admired and wanted the ability to do the splits. So one day, I decided to challenge myself to learn the full middle splits as quickly as I could (while still being safe!!!). And with a bit of commitment and a lot of effort, I was able to increase my flexibility by a surprising amount in just 4 weeks! Hope you enjoy the video and find some value in it!\n\nThis is my first time ever doing something like this (recording, editing, and speaking in a video) and even though it was a difficult, slightly embarrassing, and sometimes frustrating process, I quite enjoyed it and I'm proud of the end result!

In symbiosis with the album title, 'Drif' consists of a flock, a collection, a gathering, a collage of songs, that much like little flames were seeking towards each other, to join, to bond, to create, and be greater together. This album has very clearly dictated its own path. Our attempts to tame it was repeatedly fruitless and once we came to this realization, the creative flow surged forward with immense force, so much so that sometimes it felt like the songs wrote themselves. All the songs on 'Drif' have their own stories. They have each their place and sense of belonging, with inspiration not only from Northern Europe, but from the ancient great civilizations.‚Äù\n\n#heilung #Drif #AmplifiedHistory\n\nFollow Heilung: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/amplifiedhistory\nhttps://www.instagram.com/amplifiedhistory\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3Jvz7FpBsY73_wEjFV67wQ\nhttps://heilung.bandcamp.com/\nhttps://amplifiedhistorytour.com/\n\nSubscribe to Season Of Mist for new releases : https://som.lnk.to/YouTube\n\nFollow Season Of Mist:\nhttp://www.season-of-mist.com\nhttp://www.facebook.com/seasonofmistofficial\nhttps://www.instagram.com/seasonofmistofficial\nhttps://twitter.com/seasonofmistofficial\nhttp://www.youtube.com/SeasonOfMistLabel\nhttps://open.spotify.com/user/seasonofmist\n\n---\nSeason of Mist has always been known for being an innovative and wide spectrum label, interested in exploring and developing new artists and bands.

The game has changed a lot since the beginning. There is a new pop type: nobles and there is a new UI. More aspects of the game now work dynamically. Levies and cohorts instead of just building an army and many more changes.\n\nForge the Greatest Empire the World Has Ever Known\nAlexander. Hannibal. Caesar. These great men and dozens like them shaped the destiny of a continent. Mighty kings, clever generals and would-be gods made their mark on the ancient Mediterranean.\n\nAround this sea, close-knit nations tested their mettle and virtue against each other in fierce combat, their cultural and political legacy now inseparable from what we understand as Western Civilization. But nothing was guaranteed. Can you change the course of history in Imperator: Rome?\n\nMAIN FEATURES\nCharacter Management:\nA living world of characters with varying skills and traits that will change over time. They will lead your nation, govern your provinces and command your armies and fleets. We also introduce our new, more human-like character art.\n\nDiverce Populations:\nCitizens, freemen, tribesmen and slaves - each population with its own culture and religion. Whether they fill your armies, fill your coffers or fill your colonies, keep an eye on their happiness - your success depends on their satisfaction.\n\n\nBattle Tactics:\nChoose your approach before battle to counter the stratagems of your foes.\n\nMilitary Traditions:\nEach culture has a unique way of waging war. Romans and Celts have different options available to them. Unlock unique bonuses, abilities and units.\n\nDifferent Government Types:\nManage the senate in a Republic, hold your court together in a monarchy, answer to the clans in a tribal system.\n\nBarbarians and Rebellions:\nMigrating barbarians may sack or settle your best land, while disloyal governors or generals can turn against you - taking their armies with them!\n\nTrade:\nGoods provide bonuses to their home province. Will you take advantage of stockpiles for local strength or trade excess goods to spread the wealth around?\n\nProvincial Improvement:\nInvest in buildings, roads and defences to make your kingdom stronger and richer.\n\n‚ñ∫PATREON https://www.patreon.com/flyingdutchy\nFor people who want to support me in my YouTube and Twitch career, I now have a patreon page.

For best results, it is recommended not to consume any heavy, processed foods and liquids (including caffeinated beverages) at least 4 hours before going to bed. If possible, no food consumption is preferable. \n\nThis session uses the commonly known 'Reality Check' technique which helps you become aware of your current reality, whether it'd be in your waking state or inside your dream. Whilst in a dream, you are thus encouraged to become lucid. Our Reality Check will be presented to you in the form of several questions which you will be asked to answer based on your perception and awareness.\n\nThe Structure Of Our Hypnosis:\n\n- Introduction\n- Awareness Practice (Preparation for the Reality Checks)\n- Relaxation\n- Reality Check (Whilst Awake)\n- Deepening of the Relaxation (Falling Asleep)\n- 'Lucid Dreaming' Hypnotic Suggestions\n\n- Deep Sleep (1 hour)\n- REM Sleep / Dreaming (1 hour 13 mins)\n\n- 'Lucid Dreaming' Induction (Spoken Words Return)\n- Reality Check (Whilst Dreaming)\n- REM Sleep / Dreaming (10 mins)\n- Reality Check (Whilst Dreaming - 2nd attempt)\n- End of Session\n\nI hope you'll enjoy this session. Best of luck and sweet lucid dreams! :)\n\n~Lights of Venus~\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nhttps://www.facebook.com/lightsofvenus/\nhttps://twitter.com/Lights_of_Venus\nhttps://soundcloud.com/lightsofvenus\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis audio uses binaural beats and an isochronic pulse.

In this student critique, we‚Äôll examine the work of two students who focused on drawing foot bones without following the big-to-small hierarchy. I‚Äôll show you a 2D technique called ‚Äúenveloping‚Äù and then a 3D process that helps keep your forms dynamic and in proportion. Woo!\n\nPREMIUM - Want more?

But, a recent shift in the development landscape has seen some developers and teams moving away from TypeScript and towards JavaScript with JSDoc. This shift has been notably championed by the Svelte team, who have decided to migrate from TypeScript to JavaScript in the Svelte 4 codebase.\n\n## References\n\n1.

{"videoId":"QFhM3G4IvsY","title":"Imperator: Rome - Bactrian Infestation - Part 1","author":"Fungusen","authorId":"UCyaljHuNSYa-V4BiO72JbMA","published":1669849200000,"description":"The results of the vote are in and it appears like we will be going for a new Imperator: Rome campaign. After the horror that was focusing on the navy in the last episode we won't be doing any gimmicks this time. Especially since it has now been quite a while since I last played the game!\n\nFor this campaign we will be playing as Bactria and go for their associated achievements which are:\n\n- The Man who would be King\n- To the End of the World\n\nThere is a bit of an overlap between them but essentially it means we need to become independent and conquer our way into the Indian subcontinent. As for most of the campaigns we have been running recently the start is the dangerous part. We start as a subject to the Seleukids and we also have Maurya to the east breathing down our neck even after we become independent.\n\nThe initial plan is to wait for the Seleukids to start fighting the Antigonids and use that as an opportunity to break free. After that we shall hope that Maurya focuses mainly on the southern part of India before they start eyeing us up. Can we survive these initial dangers, the rest of the run should be relatively smooth (famous last words!).\n\nAs always, hope you enjoy!\n\nPlaylist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtfz6OsHDpNlF9_1Rq4ba79olNb2dail5\n\n\nImperator: Rome\nCopyright ¬© 2019 Paradox Interactive AB. www.paradoxplaza.com\n\nThumbnail image by Syaibatulhamdi from Pixabay (https://pixabay.com/users/syaibatulhamdi-13452116/)\n\n#Fungusen #ImperatorRome #strategy","viewCount":945,"lengthSeconds":1525,"watchProgress":1525.20272,"timeWatched":1686242293233,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"THXeYPcUBiOnG00e"}

We are happy to announce that, through minutes of research and a hard look at what we do, we've decided to unveil the new direction of our channel: Radio for artists!  Stan‚Äôs had a passion for radio since he was a little Prokolet, designing fire mix tapes and pushing them on all his friends and family.  But alas, life can really beat you down and he had to give up his dreams of putting music to Youtube-algorithmically-specific titles and descriptions to squeeze the most views out of a video, to do something more practical like drawing.\n\nBut now, with your support over these past few years, we‚Äôve finally made it to a point where the team can really focus on making those niche radio stations that you‚Äôll be coming back to for years.

We may get others.\n\nTHIS IS NOT ME!. The winner will be contacting fed by an account with my name only and I will speak to you on the phone or video before I ask for any personal details. You will also see you have been picked on our latest live video. Do not give details to scammers\n\nWINNER 1 - Lap87\nWINNER 2 - drawn @25,000 views\nWINNER 3 - drawn @50,000 views\n\n\nWell, the time has come - this is one that many people have been excited to watch! and yes, this is 20 minutes of me gushing over this printer? Why? The print quality is only on par with other printers I've reviewed of late... Well, watch the video to find out, because it's not about what it does, but how it does it!\n\nGIVEAWAY DETAILS\nUnformation wants a wider community reach, I want more YouTube Subscribers. You want a chance to win a free printer‚Ä¶ So let‚Äôs work together to make that happen. \n\nThe Competition is open to everyone that Uniformation ships to ‚Äì so to check eligibility, please see their page and ensure they ship to your locale https://www.uniformation3d.com/?sca_ref=3575400.VmDMwlcezK\n\nWe have up to 3 bundles to give away (1 bundle to each winner), each bundle will include;\n\n1 x  UniFormation GKTWO 3d Printer\n1 x Ultrasonic Resin Cleaner W230\n1 x D265 10.2‚Ä≥ Curing Station\n(FREE SHIPPING - watch out for scammers, we will not ask for any money from you)\n\nThat‚Äôs over ‚Ç¨1300 USD (¬£1000 GBP) worth of stuff per winner! \n\nSo, here are the 5 simple steps to win. and it all revolves around increasing the visibility of this video, printer and brand as I noted above. Perform the following on \"THIS\" video.\n\n1. BE A SUBSCRIBER on my channel\n2. CLICK ‚ÄúLIKE‚Äù on the video\n3. WATCH THE FULL VIDEO ‚Äì I don‚Äôt care if you leave it playing on your phone in another room with the sound off, but watch it end-to-end, because this helps Youtube recommend it to others.\n4. COMMENT ON THE VIDEO and tell me what you like to print/want to print on the GKTWO \n5. SHARE THE VIDEO ‚Äì I don‚Äôt much care where, however, IT NEEDS TO BE A \"LINK\" TO THE VIDEO! tag me if you want. We will need to ask the drawn winner for proof this was done. You stick it in a Reddit post, on a forum post on Twitter, on your Facebook page, in a Facebook group! ‚Äì But it needs to be \"public\" because we will be asking for a link to it as proof this step was done and remains live when the prize draws are done. If the drawn winner cannot show live evidence of the share, we will nullify the win and re-draw the prize.\n\nYes, it‚Äôs a bigger ask than most competitions, but it‚Äôs a much bigger prize pool than most too!. These manual steps very much help to ensure we avoid robots, scalpers and scammers from entering. \n\nWARNING - if anyone other than me replies to your comment saying you won! ignore it until we speak directly. DO NOT CLICK ON ANY LINKS sent by others, DO NOT PROVIDE PERSONAL DETAILS to people you don't know!!!\n\nHere‚Äôs when the Prize Draws will happen and how you can see them.\n\nOnce again, it will be on the YouTube Channel. The first draw will happen when this Video gets 10,000 views, the second draw will be at 25,000 views and the third at 50,000 views. And that‚Äôs views, not Subscribers ‚Äì and yes, I am aware that people can just play the video on repeat to increase the views.\n\nWhen we hit those view milestones, I will do a live video with every name in the pool and announce the winner. I will then contact the winner, verify they are the correct person and that all the steps above were followed. I will pass their details onto Uniformation for them to ship you a printer with Wash and cure stations as a bundle.\n\nGiveaway End Date - July 31st 2023 (so we need 50k views by then!

It was the exercise that made me realize that drawing is a skill that can be learned - and anyone can do it. This exercise originates from the book, \"Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\", by Betty Edwards. This is a must read for anyone wanting to learn how to draw. The premise is based on our right brain and that our left brain needs to be subdued in order for our right brains to take over. To force this to happen, we simply flip our reference upside down and draw it this way. \n***\nRelated Drawing Courses...\n25 Days to Better Drawings - https://thevirtualinstructor.com/members/25-days-to-better-drawings/\nRealistic Pencil Drawing - https://thevirtualinstructor.com/members/realistic-pencil-drawing/\nThe Secrets to Drawing - https://thevirtualinstructor.com/members/the-secrets-to-drawing/\n***\n(The following link is an affiliate link which means I make a small commission if you purchase)\nYou can find \"Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" here...https://amzn.to/3mluCwx","viewCount":2618693,"lengthSeconds":452,"watchProgress":239.250487,"timeWatched":1672773759800,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"WRN2UaY5niNHUmOr"}

Uses beta wave tones to help you reach and maintain a high focus mental state.  Use when working on advanced and complicated topics like mathematics, scientific formulas, financial analysis or any complex mental activity.\n\nIsochronic tones produce a stronger and more powerful brainwave entrainment effect, compared to binaural beats study music tracks or standard music.  \n\n‚ñ∫ Subscribe to my channel and be updated with my latest tracks:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/MindAmend?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWhat is this?\n\nThis is a high-intensity audio brainwave entrainment session, using isochronic tones.  Listen to this when you need a strong burst of intense focus to concentrate and study things like advanced mathematics, scientific formulas, financial analysis or any other complex mental activity. \n\nHow is this session constructed?\n\nThe session starts off beating at 10Hz and ramps up to 18Hz by the 6-minute mark.  It stays at 18Hz until the final 5 minutes where it ramps back down again.\n\nHow to use it?\n\nListen to this track with your eyes open while doing the task/activity you want to focus on.\n\nHeadphones are NOT required\n\nAlthough headphones are not required you may find they produce a more intense effect, because they help to block out distracting external sounds. \n\nWhen to listen?\n\nBecause this track increases your beta brainwave activity, it's best to listen to this during the daytime and early evening.  If you listen to this too close to bedtime, it might disrupt your sleep, in a similar way to how you might respond if you drank coffee just before going to bed.\n\nHow loud should the volume be?\n\nThe main thing to consider is that it should be loud enough to hear the repetitive isochronic tones, so you don't want it so quiet you can hardly hear them.  But you also don't want it so loud that it's uncomfortable for you and hurts your ears, or gives you a headache.  I'd recommend starting with the volume around halfway and adjust it to a level that you feel comfortable with from there.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nArtist credit: Tomas Novoa\nTracks: Arrecife, Ccenaga, Brotes, Prisma, Tundra\n--------------------------------------------------------","viewCount":4199192,"lengthSeconds":10800,"watchProgress":10404.548451,"timeWatched":1682500032354,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"X5nc4UpShNzfi758"}

Owners can:\n- access the Billing page;\n- manage the subscription;\n- access the payment receipts;\n- delete an account. \n\nTeam ownership can be transferred to any other admin on a team.\n\n2) Admin: full access (except exclusive privileges of the team owner). Admins can see projects and tasks of all users, regardless of whether they are assigned to the project or not. This is due to the fact that any admin should see the same totals in reports and be able to configure project billing and budgeting. \n\n3) Member: ordinary employee. Members can report time into projects and tasks they are assigned to. They can see other team members and their contributions to common projects. Members do not have access to money-related information. \n\n4) Supervisor: intermediate role between admin and member. Supervisors can see, add or edit the time for other users, but only in common projects. Supervisors do not see a member until they have an intersection on projects.

The lighting is designed to create clear and interesting shadow shapes and the poses are fun and dynamic!\n\nWatch Part 2 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0VEm9Vv-c4\n\nWe are removing an entire dimension to start this 10 day challenge. By thinking 2D, we can more easily get to the heart of some of the biggest ideas the human figure presents us. If we can learn to see each of these poses in terms of the very simple 2D model we created, we can see some of the most important things we need to see for life drawing, including both gesture and structural drawing.\n\nThese ideas about the torso, shoulders, attachment of the legs, head and neck are fundamental to figure drawing, whether you are interested in gesture, anatomy or using simple 3D forms.\n\nIf you are unsure about how to see these simple shapes in these poses, there is extra guidance when you sign up to the challenge with the link above.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Intro\n0:21 Torso\n3:44 About the Fresh Eyes challenge\n4:44 Shoulders\n7:18 Attaching legs\n8:55 Neck and head\n11.07 The model as a whole\n12:59 The limitation of this model\n13:24 The side view, going 3D and more\n\nHow the Fresh Eyes challenge works:\nThere will be two tutorials here on YouTube - this one and another on day 6 (Sunday 20th Feb).\nWhen you make an account with the link above, you can access the 2D model and play around with it, trying to match the poses. Each day, you‚Äôll get a new exercise plus 5 specially designed reference photos each day to practise with and drawing. There will be additional mini-tutorials in there to explain how to see the forms in the figure, as well as the side view of the figure, plus optional live sessions for further clarification.\n\nThen on day 6 we will switch to thinking in 3D. We will build on the ideas already developed but using simple 3D forms. On day 6, a tutorial will be posted here on YouTube about drawing these ideas in 3D. Again on our website, there will be exercises each day on days 6-10, plus live sessions and extra explanations.\n\nSign up with the link above and learn to see the figure with Fresh Eyes!\n\nFor our library of reference images, go to: https://www.lovelifedrawing.com/figure-drawing-references/\n\nFollow us on Instagram where we will post more Fresh Eyes content: https://www.instagram.com/kenzoandmayko/","viewCount":142120,"lengthSeconds":921,"watchProgress":552.484382,"timeWatched":1672913154999,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"YQzdVcxAPjk9novp"}

Les dazibaos du mur de la D√©mocratie √† P√©kin sont rapidement remplac√©s par des publicit√©s, avant une √©ni√®me vague d‚Äôarrestations ‚Äì¬†d√©mocrates, d√©linquants pr√©sum√©s, jeunes urbains, ch√¥meurs ‚Äì, rappelant que la machine totalitaire perdure. Quelque 10 000 personnes sont ex√©cut√©es entre octobre 1983 et avril 1984, et le laogai se remplit √† nouveau. Un temps √©pargn√©s, les √©tudiants organisent des manifestions prod√©mocratiques, jusqu‚Äôau massacre de Tian‚Äôanmen en juin 1989. √Ä l‚Äôaube des ann√©es 1990, la Chine compte plus de deux mille camps. √Ä l‚Äôheure o√π le capitalisme d‚Äô√âtat encourage l‚Äôenrichissement, les produits export√©s en Occident sont tach√©s du sang des prisonniers. Accus√©s de d√©rive sectaire, les adeptes du Falun Gong constituent ensuite les nouvelles cibles. En 2012, Xi Jinping, dont le p√®re a √©t√© pers√©cut√© ‚Äì ainsi qu'il le sera ensuite¬†lui-m√™me, √† l‚Äôadolescence ‚Äì, prend la t√™te du Parti, avant d‚Äô√©liminer ses rivaux sous couvert de lutte anticorruption. Les candidats √† la dissidence sur le Net et les r√©seaux sociaux sont traqu√©s, et une r√©pression massive s'abat bient√¥t sur les minorit√©s ethniques : Ou√Øghours, Kazakhs, Kirghizs‚Ä¶¬†\n \n \"Une immense prison\"¬†\n Au XXIe si√®cle, le syst√®me de r√©pression mis en place par Mao a √©t√© modernis√©, √† grand renfort de cam√©ras, d‚Äôalgorithmes et d‚Äôintelligence artificielle. Entrela√ßant archives, dont celles de la propagande, et dessins repr√©sentant la r√©alit√© int√©rieure des camps, ce documentaire s‚Äôappuie sur les r√©cits poignants d‚Äôanciens prisonniers, aujourd‚Äôhui exil√©s, et d‚Äôenfants de victimes. Ces femmes et ces hommes¬†racontent les humiliations, les violences subies et les m√©thodes de d√©shumanisation.

Sachez que je n'ai rien non plus de personnel contre les Fran√ßais quand je dis les Fran√ßais et leur accent d√©gueulasse ici, je veux simplement dire quand ils imitent l'accent qu√©b√©cois, c'est d√©gueulasse, car sinon sachez les Fran√ßais que votre accent est tout le contraire d'√™tre d√©gueulasse ! \n\nAvant de commencer la description merci au Fran√ßais Thomy's pour sa petite apparition voici le lien de sa cha√Æne YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/Thomys\n\nEt oui, on doit bien l'admettre l'accent fran√ßais est un tr√®s bel accent, mais quand ils se mettent √† imiter l'accent qu√©b√©cois a deviens rapidement BEAUCOUP MOINS styl√©, mais aujourd'hui, je vous ai d√©nich√© la pire imitation de l'accent qu√©b√©cois √† mes yeux et vous le connaissez tous, c'est le Youtubeur imitateur Fran√ßais Superflame et cet homme nous as offert ce que je pourrais qualifier comme √©tant la pire imitation de l'accent qu√©b√©cois ! Alors ici, il ne s'agit pas d'une vid√©o France Vs. Qu√©bec, car y a beaucoup trop de Fran√ßais et de Qu√©b√©cois qui l'ont d√©j√† fait, √ßa, je laisse ce concept de France vs Qu√©bec √† Denyzee qui as vraiment fait √©norm√©ment de vid√©os √† ce sujet comme par exemple avec sa vid√©o L'√âcole Fran√ßaise vs Qu√©b√©coise - BACK TO SCHOOL 2018 | DENYZEE ou bien MCDO EN FRANCE VS AU QU√âBEC | DENYZEE ft. HUBY et j'en passe, je laisse le concept France Vs Qu√©bec √† Denyzee moi, j'ai autre chose √† faire ! Non-aujourd'hui, cette vid√©o concerne juste les Fran√ßais qui imitent l'accent qu√©b√©cois, car √ßa tombe bien, car je vous ai trouv√© la pire imitation de l'accent qu√©b√©cois ! D'ailleurs, je dois le souligner d'o√π le titre de cette vid√©o LA PIRE IMITATION DE L'ACCENT QU√âB√âCOIS ! Donc message aux Fran√ßais ne faites pas comme superflame et contentez vous de parler avec votre accent, car d√®s que vous commencez √† faire celui du Qu√©bec, c'est horrible ! Sans rancune √©videment mais abstenez vous car si vous ne voulez pas un v√©ritable France Vs Qu√©bec vous ferez mieux d'arr√™ter d'imiter l'accent qu√©becois car c'est vraiment scandaleux que plusieurs fran√ßais puissent se permettrent d'imiter l'accent qu√©b√©cois alors qui ne savent pas dutout comment faire dont superflame qui en est d'ailleurs l'exemple parfait √©tant donn√© que c'est lui qui √† mes yeux nous offres la pire imitation de l'accent qu√©becois Ou sinon ya d'autres youtuber d'origines fran√ßaise comme Denyzee justement qui veux t'apprendre √† parler qu√©becois alors qu'elle est fran√ßaise dans sa vid√©o PARLER QU√âB√âCOIS EN 5 MINUTES | DENYZEE ou bien l'imitiation de minute facile qui est fran√ßais dans sa vid√©o Imiter l'accent quebecois, qui imite l'accent qu√©b√©cois et c'est sans grande surprise bien bien bien d√©gueulasse ! En fait ma vid√©o ressemblera plus √† celle de Gurky dans Un Qu√©b√©cois r√©agit aux pires imitations de l‚Äôaccent Qu√©b√©cois car moi aussi, je r√©agis justement √† la pire imitation de l'accent qu√©b√©cois ! Donc message √† superflame, Denyzee, minute facile ce conseil viens d'un Qu√©b√©cois ARR√äTEZ D'IMITER NOTRE ACCENT C'EST D√âGUEULASSE !!!\n\nVoici d'ailleurs la vid√©o originale de Superflame qui imite l'accent qu√©b√©cois et sans grande surprise, c'est d√©gueulasse !\n\nD√âFI : IMITER L'ACCENT QU√âB√âCOIS : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqP5pNzyC1s\n\nHeureusement que ta vid√©o s'apelle D√âFI IMITER L'ACCENT QU√âBECOIS, car si √ßa l'aurait √©t√© affirm√© malheureusement, c'est rat√©, car c'est vraiment la pire imitation de l'accent qu√©b√©cois du monde !\n\nLa Louze est un concept d'analyse de vid√©os humoristique amen√© avec beaucoup d'humour noir et de satires, anim√© par nulle autre que le Roi Arthur, si vous √©tiez fervent de What The Cut ou bien de Salut Les Geek ce concept fera rena√Ætre en vous cette nostalgie perdue avec les deux concepts nomm√©s ci-dessous ce coup-ci anim√© au Qu√©bec !\n\n√âtant donn√© que √ßa fait au-dessus de 15 ans que YouTube existe, je n'ai √©videmment pas besoin de te r√©p√©ter la m√™me chanson √† chaque fois...\n\nOk, j'ai compris.\n\nüëçTu likes.üëç\nüìùTu √©cris un commentaire pour me dire √† quel point tu me trouves g√©nial.üìù\nü§ôTu partages au maximum la vid√©o.

Part of my peak focus for complex tasks series.  Beta isochronic tones - reach a high focus mental state.\n\nUse this track when working on advanced and complicated topics like coding/programming, mathematics, scientific formulas, financial analysis or any complex mental activity.\n\nIsochronic tones produce a stronger and more powerful brainwave entrainment effect, compared to binaural beats study music tracks or standard music.\n\n‚ñ∫ Subscribe to my channel and be updated with my latest tracks:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/MindAmend?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWhat is this?\n\nThis is a high-intensity audio brainwave entrainment session, using isochronic tones.  Listen to this when you need a strong burst of intense focus to concentrate and study things like advanced mathematics, scientific formulas, financial analysis or any other complex mental activity. \n\nHow is this session constructed?\n\nThe session starts off beating at 10Hz and ramps up to 18Hz by the 6-minute mark.  It stays at 18Hz until the final 5 minutes where it ramps back down again.\n\nHow to use it?\n\nListen to this track with your eyes open while doing the task/activity you want to focus on.\n\nHeadphones are NOT required\n\nAlthough headphones are not required you may find they produce a more intense effect, because they help to block out distracting external sounds. \n\nWhen to listen?\n\nBecause this track increases your beta brainwave activity, it's best to listen to this during the daytime and early evening.  If you listen to this too close to bedtime, it might disrupt your sleep, in a similar way to how you might respond if you drank coffee just before going to bed.\n\nHow loud should the volume be?\n\nThe main thing to consider is that it should be loud enough to hear the repetitive isochronic tones, so you don't want it so quiet you can hardly hear them.  But you also don't want it so loud that it's uncomfortable for you and hurts your ears, or gives you a headache.  I'd recommend starting with the volume around halfway and adjust it to a level that you feel comfortable with from there.\n\n#upbeatstudymusic\n#housemusicforstudying\n#focusmusic\n\n------\nArtist credit: 2050\nFrom the albums Crossing the Atlantic, Human.","viewCount":465565,"lengthSeconds":14400,"watchProgress":4143.925335,"timeWatched":1686557536552,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"bxDYUzNYEvwaP4mw"}

If you want to learn how to edge highlight your miniature, this short tutorial is for you!\n\nThere is no true shortcut to getting precise, thin and consistent edge highlights that you can see on warhammer box arts. If you want to paint that very similar eavy metal style that you can see there (which suits space marines for me, honestly) you will have to practice edge highlighting as much as you can - for which space marines and drukhari are actually great!\n\nThis video will definitely help you with fundamentals of edge highlighting, but as mentioned, it all comes down to deliberate practice (when I do not count quality brushes). You could also choose to paint everything with drybrushing, sure, but with that you will not achieve that eavy metal look - but this can still look great on your miniatures.\n\nThese videos are essential watch if you want to improve:\nPainting Volumes: https://youtu.be/mw4NcKqaPJ0\nPainting Non Metallic Metal: https://youtu.be/wOGlHTRySlU \n\nThese hobby tools are a MUST if you wanna improve: https://youtu.be/UqgElHtomVw\n\nSupport the channel by purchasing any hobby products using following links (As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases you do after using these links at no extra cost for you)\n\nAmazon US:\nAny product: https://amzn.to/37GMBGT\nI use Panasonic GH5 camera: https://amzn.to/3qNOTLP\nBasic Vallejo Colors: https://amzn.to/3pJd2BI\nLAMP: https://amzn.to/3s7wiuK \nVallejo Texture Paste: https://amzn.to/3CiHA4M\nWinsor and Newton series 7 brush: https://amzn.to/3yshutO\nStarting airbrush set: https://amzn.to/3s8NhwI\n\nAmazon UK:\nAny product: https://amzn.to/3wGfBK3\nI use Panasonic GH5 camera: https://amzn.to/30aZVCX\nBasic Vallejo paints: https://amzn.to/30fybNn\nLAMP: https://amzn.to/3og7T5J\nStarting airbrush set: https://amzn.to/2YzNDTD\n\nAmazon DE (and EU):\nAny product: https://amzn.to/392bXzs\nI use Panasonic GH5 camera: https://amzn.to/3w30DNJ\nBasic Vallejo paints: https://amzn.to/3cdUmH0\nLAMP: https://amzn.to/37hqAh1 \nStarting airbrush set: https://amzn.to/39h2CUT\n\nI use 3D printer from Anycubic: https://bit.ly/3akLGfP\n\nAll the music and soundeffects are from Epidemic Sound, support the channel by registering via this link: https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/npn6j7/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/zumikit0/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/zumikit0/\n\nI am painting miniatures for warhammer, age of sigmar, marvel crisis protocol, D&D and much more!

As stated in this video, there is 1 category. The category is SINGLE FIGURE, ANY GENRE. 95% of the figure must be under 50mm. If the tip of a dude's sword is sticking out, it's OK. If you're concerned about your entry comment below with a picture of your mini next to a ruler and I'll give you a yay or nay. Pick just about any 28mm scale mini and you should be golden. The plinth + the mini cannot be taller than 100m in total height. The base area cannot be greater than 75mm x 75mm or if a circle, greater than 75mm in diameter (yes I under stand that's not the same area, but if I asked you to calculate area, there'd be a riot on my hands). \n\n2. Take a picture of your entry UNPAINTED with a piece of paper next to it that has written on it: \"Miniac Meat Grinder 2018\". If the mini is already assembled, and primed, that's OK. SAVE THIS PICTURE. Paint your miniature. Make an awesome base. Then, take a SINGLE PHOTO of your final paint job. Pick whatever angle you think is the sexiest. YOU NEED TO FINISH BY JUNE 30TH. This gives you 2 whole months. Submit all the information here: https://goo.gl/forms/9MTRm0lJeOmKgTml2\n\n3. I will create an online gallery where anyone and everyone can vote on their favorite miniatures. Everyone's miniature will get into the online voting. The miniatures to receive the top 10 most votes will move onto the next stage. The 10 final contestants will submit MINIMUM four photos to me of each side of the miniature and anything else you want to show off. \n\n4. A panel of 5 judges will rank your submission. They will judge on three categories. Technical Skill, and Artistic Skill. To read definitions of these two, see how Crystal Brush defines them: http://www.crystalbrush.com/judging-and-voting/ . We will be using these metrics. A final and additional category will be Basing Creativity, which is straightforward. Each category will be rated out of 10. All of the judges scores will be added up for all 3 categories and the highest rated entrants will win 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place trophies and bragging rights! \n\nLet the games begin!","viewCount":121939,"lengthSeconds":1008,"watchProgress":14.29556,"timeWatched":1681980246009,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"nZ0rjj9PQGXU9Dkv"}

Listen to this when you need a strong burst of intense focus to concentrate and study things like advanced mathematics, scientific formulas, financial analysis or any other complex mental activity. \n\nHow is this session constructed?\n\nThe session starts off beating at 10Hz and ramps up to the 18Hz range by the 6-minute mark. The isochronic tones frequency then randomly fluctuates between 17.5-18.5Hz to help prevent habituation. This stops you from getting too used to the same frequency when using the track regularly over time. Once the track gets to the final 5 minutes it ramps back down to 10Hz again. You can see an image showing how the session is constructed at the beginning of the video.\n\nHow to use it?\n\nListen to this track with your eyes open while doing the task/activity you want to focus on.\n\nHeadphones are NOT required\n\nAlthough headphones are not required you may find they produce a more intense effect, because they help to block out distracting external sounds. \n\nWhen to listen?\n\nBecause this track increases your beta brainwave activity, it's best to listen to this during the daytime and early evening. If you listen to this too close to bedtime, it might disrupt your sleep, in a similar way to how you might respond if you drank coffee just before going to bed.\n\nHow loud should the volume be?\n\nThe main thing to consider is that it should be loud enough to hear the repetitive isochronic tones, so you don't want it so quiet you can hardly hear them. But you also don't want it so loud that it's uncomfortable for you and hurts your ears, or gives you a headache. I'd recommend starting with the volume around halfway and adjusting it to a level that you feel comfortable with from there.\n\nHow Isochronic Tones Work\n\nIf brainwave entrainment and isochronic tones are new concepts for you, you can find out how everything works and the potential benefits here:  http://www.mindamend.com/brainwave-entrainment/isochronic-tones/\n\n‚ñ∫ How the amplitude entrainment effects work: https://www.mindamend.com/brainwave-entrainment/mind-music/\n\n#IsochronicTonesStudy\n#FocusMusic\n#HouseStudyMusic\n-----\nOriginal music credit (music without isochronic tones)\nArtist: Majed Salih - Veliunimar, Digronomic, Attarcticus, Schetatyp, Prologos, Misophix","viewCount":93209,"lengthSeconds":10800,"watchProgress":6410.30541,"timeWatched":1682500039004,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"oxYs2D0U2OH5ZEx2"}

En quatre-vingts ans, 50 millions de \"contre-r√©volutionnaires\", ennemis de classe et autres \"droitiers\" ‚Äì¬†intellectuels, ouvriers, paysans, gardes rouges, √©tudiants‚Ä¶ ‚Äì¬†sont pass√©s par les camps du laogai (\"r√©forme par le travail\"), le syst√®me concentrationnaire chinois, et 20 millions y ont p√©ri, ex√©cut√©s ou morts d‚Äô√©puisement, de faim ou de d√©sespoir. Instrument de domination √©rig√© en arme de r√©pression massive par Mao, le laogai, constitu√© de centaines de camps r√©partis sur tout le territoire, a vocation √† √©craser toute vell√©it√© de contestation, en fournissant, par le travail forc√©, une main-d‚Äô≈ìuvre gratuite √† l‚Äô√©conomie du pays. De la premi√®re \"campagne de rectification\" au Grand Bond en avant, les purges se succ√®dent, avant de culminer avec la r√©volution culturelle, quand les unit√©s de travail urbaines se transforment en lieu de d√©tention, et les campagnes, en lieu d'exil. Tandis que la menace de d√©portation pervertit les liens les plus intimes, les familles des d√©tenus sont mises au ban de la soci√©t√©. Une terreur qui survit √† son chef‚Ä¶ ¬†\n\nM√©thodes de d√©shumanisation¬†\n\nDe la fin de la guerre civile en 1949, quand Mao fixe un quota de contre-r√©volutionnaires √† atteindre (5 millions de personnes), √† sa mort en 1976, ce premier √©pisode retrace les vagues successives de r√©pression qui ont contribu√© √† la mise en place du goulag chinois, d√©voilant l‚Äôampleur de ce redoutable syst√®me concentrationnaire. Entrela√ßant archives, dont celles de la propagande, et dessins repr√©sentant la r√©alit√© int√©rieure des camps, ce documentaire s‚Äôappuie sur les r√©cits poignants d‚Äôanciens prisonniers, aujourd‚Äôhui exil√©s, et d‚Äôenfants de victimes ‚Äì¬†dont le plasticien Ai Weiwei, qui √©voque la d√©portation de son p√®re, le grand po√®te Ai Qing. Ces femmes et ces hommes¬†racontent les humiliations, les violences subies et les m√©thodes de d√©shumanisation.

La s√©rie met en sc√®ne, avec humour et autod√©rision, les aventures de jeunes de cit√©, leur \"culture de la vanne\", du clash, des \"bastons de regards\", et des \"gros mytho\" (sans parler des probl√®mes de manque de cigarettes). \nOn est loin des histoires de jeunes de banlieue qui renvoient √† l‚Äôimage mis√©rabiliste v√©hicul√©e jusque l√† par les m√©dias. Les Lascars sont plein d‚Äôhumour, d‚Äô√©nergie et d‚Äôautod√©rision. \nAu travers de ces histoires, ce sont les th√®mes et les motifs de la vie quotidienne de la jeunesse des quartiers qui se dessinent : la pop culture urbaine, l‚Äôamiti√©, la structure de groupe, la d√®che financi√®re, le d√©sir sexuel, la frustration, l‚Äôennui, les r√™ves grandioses ou d√©risoires, la musique, la danse, le langage, les codes gestuels et comportementaux, les relations avec la police, la d√©merde √©conomique.\nLa s√©rie fait rire toutes les couches de la soci√©t√© et toutes les tranches d‚Äô√¢ge. Elle v√©hicule un message positif et optimiste sur la culture urbaine. En effet, l‚Äôhumour est le meilleur catalyseur pour la compr√©hension et la tol√©rance entre les personnes d‚Äôorigines, de milieux sociaux ou d‚Äô√¢ges diff√©rents. \n\nReflet √† la fois juste et positif de la soci√©t√©, les ¬´ Lascars ¬ª sont authentiques et le public ne s‚Äôy est pas tromp√©. Par bouche √† oreille et sans aucune action de marketing ou de promotion, la notori√©t√© est devenue colossale.\nLes ¬´ Lascars ¬ª sont devenus une s√©rie culte et embl√©matique de la jeunesse urbaine.\n\nDiffus√© sur Canal+, MCM, MTV .\n\n ************************************\nRegardez les compilations d'√©pisode des Lascars : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL59a7l4KFi02WEYV11Yp-wpJPfQJFMEEz\n\nSAISON 1 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0OkmjxZXdY&list=PL59a7l4KFi03efN3jIk-cj6bpa21Xi7zb&index=1\n\nSAISON 2 : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL59a7l4KFi01T4Pdkd2KbAdHrls9I7Yce\n\nLes Lascars en anglais : https://www.youtube.com/user/HomiezRoundDaWay?sub_confirmation=1\n\n ************************************ .\n\nLascars - saison 1: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL59a7l4KFi03efN3jIk-cj6bpa21Xi7zb\nLascars- saison 2: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL59a7l4KFi01T4Pdkd2KbAdHrls9I7Yce\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/LascarsLaSerie\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/LascarsOfficiel\nYoutube: http://www.youtube.com/user/lascarsmillimages?sub_confirmation=1","viewCount":487313,"lengthSeconds":74,"watchProgress":69.166932,"timeWatched":1682318931985,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"yJqOv3kYWCKOYl32"}
