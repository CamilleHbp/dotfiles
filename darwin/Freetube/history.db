React Query provides a hooks API which allows you to fetch, cache, and update data. At first glance it seems like just a simple library, however you'll find out that it is packed with features which pretty much handle most of the server state management concerns that you might have in any client application. This includes things like automatically de-duping requests, background refreshing, caching, optimistic updating, accessing data globally and several others.\n\nIf you make React Query manage your server state, you'll find that the remaining client state that requires management becomes VERY small and likely will remove the need for more complex solutions like Redux. This is state management solution that you absolutely should know about if you're a React developer!\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:25 - Why you need React Query\n02:08 - What we're going to build in this tutorial\n03:15 - Using axios to define our reusable API methods\n05:09 - Setting up the QueryClient and Devtools\n07:10 - Intro to fetching data with the useQuery hook\n10:06 - Utilizing loading states\n11:21 - Catching errors and basic error handling\n21:05 - Important defaults to know about\n21:26 - Auto Caching and garbage collection\n22:44 - Auto background data refetching/refreshing\n30:00 - Using mutations and the useMutation hook to update data\n33:56 - Invalidating data in the cache (trigger refresh)\n36:44 - Optimistic updates\n39:58 - Updating the cached data using the response data\n42:55 - Looking at what else React Query provides\n43:36 - Conclusion: Discuss the point of React Query and if you still need things like Redux\n45:23 - Outro","viewCount":44874,"lengthSeconds":2753,"watchProgress":1713.158807,"timeWatched":1672655608653,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"814uPydqWtYlb3rc"}

Also, sorry about the poor video quality and stuff, I'm still getting everything sorted out and really it was a matter of either making an imperfect video or not making anything at all...  Also the picture I drew for this is just whatever because I didn't know what to do but felt the video probably needed some art thing in the background.  Alright, enough about that, if you're still reading this, well, I am surprised!  I bet most people will never see whatever I'm writing here.  I probably could just write whatever and maybe 2% of people will see it.  I guess if you got this far, you can write \"I found the secret stallion!\" in the comments and people will be confused about what the heck that is about.  Or you don't have to, lol.

We are happy to announce that, through minutes of research and a hard look at what we do, we've decided to unveil the new direction of our channel: Radio for artists!  Stan‚Äôs had a passion for radio since he was a little Prokolet, designing fire mix tapes and pushing them on all his friends and family.  But alas, life can really beat you down and he had to give up his dreams of putting music to Youtube-algorithmically-specific titles and descriptions to squeeze the most views out of a video, to do something more practical like drawing.\n\nBut now, with your support over these past few years, we‚Äôve finally made it to a point where the team can really focus on making those niche radio stations that you‚Äôll be coming back to for years.

Fresh Eyes pt 1","author":"Love Life Drawing","authorId":"UCA9o111IH1VD8Kxz0YLn8_A","published":1644879600000,"description":"To join the Fresh Eyes challenge, go to: https://www.lovelifedrawing.com/fresheyes/\nThe free account you make will also give you access to our new reference library for your general figure drawing practice. The lighting is designed to create clear and interesting shadow shapes and the poses are fun and dynamic!\n\nWatch Part 2 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0VEm9Vv-c4\n\nWe are removing an entire dimension to start this 10 day challenge. By thinking 2D, we can more easily get to the heart of some of the biggest ideas the human figure presents us. If we can learn to see each of these poses in terms of the very simple 2D model we created, we can see some of the most important things we need to see for life drawing, including both gesture and structural drawing.\n\nThese ideas about the torso, shoulders, attachment of the legs, head and neck are fundamental to figure drawing, whether you are interested in gesture, anatomy or using simple 3D forms.\n\nIf you are unsure about how to see these simple shapes in these poses, there is extra guidance when you sign up to the challenge with the link above.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Intro\n0:21 Torso\n3:44 About the Fresh Eyes challenge\n4:44 Shoulders\n7:18 Attaching legs\n8:55 Neck and head\n11.07 The model as a whole\n12:59 The limitation of this model\n13:24 The side view, going 3D and more\n\nHow the Fresh Eyes challenge works:\nThere will be two tutorials here on YouTube - this one and another on day 6 (Sunday 20th Feb).\nWhen you make an account with the link above, you can access the 2D model and play around with it, trying to match the poses. Each day, you‚Äôll get a new exercise plus 5 specially designed reference photos each day to practise with and drawing. There will be additional mini-tutorials in there to explain how to see the forms in the figure, as well as the side view of the figure, plus optional live sessions for further clarification.\n\nThen on day 6 we will switch to thinking in 3D. We will build on the ideas already developed but using simple 3D forms. On day 6, a tutorial will be posted here on YouTube about drawing these ideas in 3D. Again on our website, there will be exercises each day on days 6-10, plus live sessions and extra explanations.\n\nSign up with the link above and learn to see the figure with Fresh Eyes!\n\nFor our library of reference images, go to: https://www.lovelifedrawing.com/figure-drawing-references/\n\nFollow us on Instagram where we will post more Fresh Eyes content: https://www.instagram.com/kenzoandmayko/","viewCount":142120,"lengthSeconds":921,"watchProgress":552.484382,"timeWatched":1672913154999,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"YQzdVcxAPjk9novp"}

How the local value of the object effects the tones.
